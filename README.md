# Personal CV Website

This is my personal **CV-style portfolio website**, created to showcase my background, skills, and career journey as I transition into a **Junior Full Stack Software Engineer** role.

## About the Project

The aim of this site is to present my experience, education, and projects in a clean, modern, and professional format — similar to an online résumé. It highlights my transition from **Consulting (Space and Data Management)** into **Software Development**, and documents my continued learning through **Code Institute** and **HyperionDev** bootcamps.

While I have completed several practical and academic projects (including e-commerce and management systems), these are **currently offline** while I update and redeploy them. Live demos will be restored in the near future once they’re hosted again.

Once the course is completed, I plan to deploy my projects and make them publicly accessible as part of my portfolio.

## Background

I stumbled into coding by pure chance — my wife found a 5-day coding challenge and suggested I give it a try. What started as a small experiment quickly became a genuine passion. Since then, I’ve completed a **Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (Code Institute)** and later the **HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp** to refresh my skills and stay current with modern technologies.

This website serves as both a professional introduction and a visual summary of that journey.

## Notes

I had planned to include a professional headshot, but unfortunately, the photo was stored on an old PC that unfortunately stopped working, and I still need to retrieve the hard drive and the data on it.
